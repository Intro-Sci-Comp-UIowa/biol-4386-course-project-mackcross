# CHANGE LOG 
This file describes the modifications to my homework assignments in response 
to feedback. 

# HOMEWORK1 FEEDBACK
The feedback centerted on two primary issues: lack of specificity concerning 
the proposed image to be produced from this work and need to restructure 
hypotheses to better faciliate the proposed reserach. In response to this 
feedback, I made the following adjustments:

02/23/23: Edited the image of an example phylogeny to include a description 
of the features I anticipated recreating and ideas on how I plan to do this. 
02/26/23: Restructed the reserach framework regarding the non-human 
primate phylogeny hypotheses. Began to rework hypotheses to be more 
appropriate for reserach question.  
02/27/23: Completed the current necessary revisions regarding the 
hypotheses.
