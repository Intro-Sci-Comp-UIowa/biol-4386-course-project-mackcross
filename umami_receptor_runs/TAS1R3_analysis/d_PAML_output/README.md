# PAML INPUT
This file contains the TAS1R1 files which were PAML output. T

There were multiple runs, especially initially to test functionality. These runs were placed in the test_runs directory and not used in analyses. 

The alt_hypothesis directory contains the runs which were conducted under the alternative hypothesis which allowed omega to vary. Please refer to the PAML_input folder for the codeml.ctl file which set the parameters for these runs. 

The null_hypothesis directory contains the runs which were conducted under the null hypothesis which fixed omega to 1. Please refer to the PAML_input folder for the codeml.ctl file which set the parameters for these runs.
