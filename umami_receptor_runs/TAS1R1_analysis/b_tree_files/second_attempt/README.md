This is a reanalysis of the alignment into a ML tree. The previously 
generated tree contained polytomies as it was a concensus bootstrap. In 
this analysis, both a concensus bootstrap and a ML tree were obtained. The 
steps to produce these trees are described below. 

METHODS
The command-line PAUP program was downloaded (paup4a168_osx.gz) for Mac OS 
X. The analysis was completed using this program. The original aligned DNA 
sequence was opened and a duplicate was saved into phylip file format. The 
PAUP settings are as dictated within the file 
Human_TAS1R1_orthologues_DNA_aligned_nexus. This file was executed in 
PAUP.
