This is a reanalysis of the alignment into a ML tree. The previously generated tree contained polytomies as it was a consensus bootstrap. In this analysis, both a consensus bootstrap and a ML tree were obtained. The steps to produce these trees are described below. 

METHODS
The command-line PAUP program was downloaded (paup4a168_osx.gz) for Mac OS X on 03/22/2023. The analysis was completed using this program. The original aligned DNA sequence was opened and a duplicate was saved into phylip file format. The PAUP settings are as dictated within the file Human_TAS1R1_orthologues_DNA_aligned_nexus. This file was executed in PAUP. The resultant files were saved and the files used for input were copied, placed in the PAML input file as well.
