# INTRODUCTION 
This is the file which will contain all necessary materials to begin my PAML analysis of TAS1R1. I copied the alignment file and the tree file from the other folders, then placed the copies within this folder. To prepare for the runs, I made the following adjustments to the files:

Alignment: 
1) I deleted the segments of the alignment where only one primate had nucleotides. This only included the end of the bamboo lemur sequence. 
2) I saved the alignment as a text file. 
3) I opened the file in a text editor and I edited the names to reflect the common name but left their identifying code to aid in clarity of analysis. 
4) I opened the file in a text editor and added numbers to the start of each sequence and labeled them in chronological order. 

Phylogenetic Tree File: 
1) I opened the tree file and exported it into a new file in Newick format. 
2) I renamed each sequence to be identical to the alignment name changes.
